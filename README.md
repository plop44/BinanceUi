App used to showcase a few WPF concepts:
- Automated UI test using Microsoft.Automation
- MVVM with ViewModel first approach (DataTemplate)
- WPF Behaviors
- WPF Converters
- WPF change mechanism wired up in Rx
etc.

The appearance of the rendering is not very nice, as only native WPF controls were utilized and not much time was spent on restyling them. 
In a production application, it would be more likely to use a third-party control library like DevExpress or Telerik, which comes with styling themes. 
Deeply styling controls is not a common task.
